                The Bruins have a long successful history with many championships in the early and mid-1900’s then not winning a Stanley cup from 1972-2011 (39 years). They’ve had so many great players throughout the years which include Bobby Orr, Phil Esposito, Ray Bourque, Cam Neely, Patrice Bergeron, Zdeno Chara, and many more. The last championship the Bruins won was in 2011, but they have reached the Finals two separate times in 2013 and 2019. This past season the Bruins broke many NHL records in which they set the new all-time record for most wins and most points in a single-season, but they lost in the first round of the playoffs.
