           Boston is the home of several major professional sports franchises, which includes the New England Patriots (football), the Red Sox (baseball), the Celtics (basketball), and the Bruins (hockey). Sports are a major part of the cityâ€™s culture. The fans are known for their crazed devotion to these teams. Boston is the only city in American professional sports that has all their facilities privately owned and operated. These include Fenway Park (Red Sox), TD Garden (Celtics & Bruins), and Gilette Stadium (Patriots).

            All of the Boston sports franchises have a long history that spans for almost a century with many moments of success and droughts. The most recent achievements have come from the major success of all four franchises during the 21st century. Since the turn of the century, Boston teams have won 12 championships: six by the Patriots, four by the Red Sox, and one each by the Celtics and Bruins. After the Bruins won the Stanley Cup Finals in 2011, Boston became the first city to ever have championship wins in four major professional leagues within a ten-year span.

Their success has led to Boston becoming the most iconic sports city in America and welcoming one of the most amazing and diehard fanbases in the country. The success and stature of these teams even trickles down to the college level with some colleges participating in the highest level of college sports (Division I). These include Harvard, Boston College, Boston University, and Northeastern.
